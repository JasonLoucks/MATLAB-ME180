# MATLAB-ME180
This is all of the MATLAB code I wrote for ME 180 at Sac State during the Spring 2024 semester, plus additional files.

As the semester went on, I made changes to the functions, etc. that I wrote. Generally, the newer code is more modular and portable, with the side effect that much of the older code WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT UPDATING. I have no plans to update the older code. You are free to update it, but I will not provide support.
